Test Version to write to the Paradox bus using Arduino and level shift.

This is still very much beta as the communication don't work 100% at all times. Not sure why this happening as yet.

To use it, simply open serial port, enter your pin code ie 1 2 3 4 and paradox should start setting alarm
To do stay arm, press letter "V"

Connect to paradox bus using https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009 or your own method.
